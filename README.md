# Robot_Run
Hi there, this is my first ever python game so it may not be the best.
Robot Run is a frogger-bassed game where the objective is to get to the other side
Use the controls W A S and D to move your robot
I'm this game you will join Timmy the robot in his adventures through lasers, robots, and even bigger lasers!
After you defeat the boss you will be able to play in high score mode but watch out, everything gets faster after each level in this mode.
You have 3 lives and once those are up you restart!
you will need to install pygame and python for this to work
here are the download links
pygame: run pip install pygame
python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
run main to start the game
i included a .ico picture in the resources folder for when you make a shortcut (make it for main)
enjoy!
