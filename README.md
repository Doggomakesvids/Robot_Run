# Robot_Run
Hi there, this is my first ever python game so it may not be the best.
you will need to install pygame and python for this to work
here are the download links
pygame: run pip install pygame
python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
run main to start the game
i included a .ico picture in the resources folder for when you make a shortcut (make it for main)
enjoy!
